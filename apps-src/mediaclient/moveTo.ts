// Moving a long list without repainting it.
//
// A native scroll of a virtualised list is expensive on this hardware: measured
// on the box, animating one row of the library cost the GPU process 111-118 ms
// against 18-23 ms for the same distance jumped. That is not what the hardware
// can do - Plex's own client animates its grid on the same box and reads as
// smooth - it is what a scrolling container costs when its contents are being
// rebuilt underneath it.
//
// Plex's technique, read out of its bundle: it does not scroll at all. There is
// no `scrollIntoView` and no `scroll-behavior` anywhere in it. Positions are
// `translateX/translateY`, and movement is a Web Animations API keyframe pair
// on `transform` with an explicit duration:
//
//   keyframes: [{transform:"translate(0vw, 0vh)"}, {transform:"translate(Xvw, Yvh)"}]
//   options:   {delay, duration, fill: "forwards"}
//
// A transform animation runs on the compositor: no layout, no paint, no raster.
// This is the same idea, in pixels rather than viewport units, because the
// distances here come from a measured row height.
