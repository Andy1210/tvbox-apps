// Kept as a copy rather than aliased across the repo boundary: it imports
// `vitest` and `@testing-library/react` as bare specifiers, which resolve from
// the importing file's own tree - and CI installs node_modules only in
// tvbox-apps, so an alias would work locally and fail there. Two resolutions of
// React is also exactly the hazard every vite.config.ts here fights with dedupe.
//
// Shared by every app under apps-src/, since the media client is no longer the
// only one that walks its screens with the arrows.

// D-pad remote harness. On the box the CEC bridge turns TV-remote presses into
// arrow keys + Enter, which norigin-spatial-navigation maps to directional focus
// moves. norigin resolves the direction geometrically from each focusable's
// layout - but happy-dom has no layout engine, so every element measures as an
// all-zero rect and real navigation is impossible out of the box. We give each
// element a fake rect (assigned by the test via place()/placeGrid()) and hand
// norigin a custom layoutAdapter.measureLayout that reads it, so a test lays its
// focusables out on a synthetic 2D plane and the arrow keys walk them exactly as
// they would on a TV.
//
// Since norigin 3.2.1 the geometry hook is the layoutAdapter API (the old
// useGetBoundingClientRect flag is deprecated), measureLayout returns a Promise,
// and every focus mutation (key nav, setFocus, mount registration) runs through
// the library's async Scheduler - focus lands on a later microtask, not
// synchronously. That is why the key-press helpers and setFocus here are async:
// they dispatch, then drain the microtask queue inside act() so the focus (and
// the React state it flips) has settled before the test asserts. The drain is
// pure microtasks - the scheduler never touches timers - so it also works under
// vi.useFakeTimers().
